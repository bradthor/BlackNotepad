# Black Notepad

A black 'version' of the classic Microsoft Windows Notepad application because real Windows users work in the dark ;)

## TODO ##

* Emulate the replace behaviour that highlights the text sought prior to replacing it (by clicking replace a second time)
* Font colour and family menu check marks are not updated at load
* Need to prepare release to Windows Store
