# Black Notepad

A black 'version' of the classic Microsoft Windows Notepad application because real Windows users work in the dark ;)

## TODO ##

* GoTo doesn't seem to go to last line when that is the target
* Find button should be default
* Find next gets stuck on caret position not moved after first find
* Implement 'Wrap around' so find (replace) return to the start of the file after reaching the end
* Emulate the replace behaviour that highlights the text sought prior to replacing it (by clicking replace a second time)
* Font colour and family menu check marks are not updated at load
* Title not updating on Save
* Need to prepare release to Windows Store
