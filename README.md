# Black Notepad

A black 'version' of the classic Microsoft Windows Notepad application because real Windows users work in the dark ;)

## TODO ##

* Move all interfaces to one place
* Dialogs should not be modal
* Implement 'Wrap around' so find (replace) return to the start of the file after reaching the end
* Emulate the replace behaviour that highlights the text sought prior to replacing it (by clicking replace a second time)
* Font colour and family menu check marks are not updated at load
* Focus on search text box on find dialog show
* Title not updating on Save
* Need to add GoTo logic
* Need to add Find and Replace logic
* Need to prepare release to Windows Store
